                <p> NiFi is a graphical flow-based tool by Apache, designed to automate data flow between systems,
                    working in the ETL (extract, transform, load) model. Looking at a fully formed flow in NiFi might
                    look intimidating with its nodes and paths going in every direction, but it's actually incredibly
                    simple. If you are familiar with <strong>Flow Based Programming</strong>, working with NiFi should
                    be effortless. A flow in NiFi has two main objects that make it up: <em>FlowFiles</em> and
                    <em>Components</em>. </p>

                <h2 id="flowfiles">FlowFiles</h2>
                <p>
                    <em>FlowFiles</em> are individual objects that are the data in the system. Think of them as JSON
                    objects that are being pushed around, sorted, and transformed by the Processors. Each FlowFile has a
                    <code>content</code> attribute, which represents the actual body of data (which can be empty), as
                    well as a collection of other attributes which usually act as metadata for information about where
                    the file came from and where it should go. At any given moment, FlowFiles are blazing through the
                    system at some immeasurable speed, and they can be hard to observe individually while it's running.
                    The only place they really exist is in the Queues between processors waiting for their turn.
                </p>
                <blockquote class="tip">
                    <p> Tracking these FlowFiles through the system is an important skill necessary in figuring out what

                <h2 id="components">Components</h2>
                <p> Components are the actual nodes on the canvas. Your components are listed on the top bar in your
                    component palette. All of these are entirely unnecessary with the exception of the first option—the
                    processor, which is the workhorse of the flow. </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="res/component-palette.png" alt="Component Palette" />
                    <figcaption>There are a lot of components, but you'll only ever need one.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <h3 id="processors">Processors</h3>
                <p> Processors are the nodes in the system that actually do the work. They are generally designed to do
                    one thing to a FlowFile. Think of each of these as one function call. You may be wondering, "Why
                    create a complicated flow when the same process would be much simpler to make in a real programming
                    language?" </p>
                <p> Anyway, processors extract, transform, and load the FlowFiles. Processor functions include pulling
                    data from APIs or databases, routing FlowFiles based on its attributes, running a JSON
                    transformation routine, and even running scripts. </p>
                <p>To create a processor, you click and drag the processor icon from the palette onto the canvas where
                    you want it, like a child playing with LEGO.</p>
                <blockquote class="tip">
                    <p> Now's a good time to bring up that if you're stressing about being able to use a bunch of handy
                        keyboard shortcuts—don't worry! NiFi has virtually <em>none</em>—not even undo! </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p> After you place the processor, a window will appear showing hundreds of different processor options,
                    at which point you might wonder why this couldn't have just been a button. The processors are
                    helpfully tagged and sorted according to their functions, so if you know you need to interact with a
                    JSON, you can just click the JSON tag and see all the options applicable. </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="res/all-processors.png" alt="All processors" />
                    <figcaption>There are even more components, and you won't use even more of them.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <h3 id="properites">Properties—Configuring Processors</h3>
                <p> The properties tab is where you can specify the key/value pairs that the processor uses to make its
                    decisions. Let's have a look at the <strong>InvokeHTTP</strong> processor's properties by double
                    clicking it. </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="res/invokehttp.png" alt="InvokeHTTP" />
                    <figcaption>Makes you wonder what was wrong with <code>fetch()</code>.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p> As you can see, there are a lot of properties, most of which you can safely ignore. The necessary
                    ones are <strong>highlighted in bold</strong>, and the question mark icons can be hovered over to
                    get further information about the property. Remember that you can't configure a processor while it's
                    running. </p>
                <p> Once you've configured the processor correctly, you can click the checkbox in the upper right-hand
                    corner to see if NiFi agrees. Once everything is in order you can click <em>Apply</em>. It's
                    important to keep in mind that if the processor isn't entirely happy with its configuration, it will
                    refuse to start. </p>

                </blockquote>
                <h3 id="relationships">Relationships—Connecting Processors</h3>
                <p> After a few processors are on the flow, you can connect them together by dragging a line from the
                    former to the latter, depending on which direction you want data to flow. Next, it's gonna ask you
                    for which relationship you're trying to create the connection. </p>
                <p> Processors have inputs and outputs where the data goes through. Processors can have many output
                    conditions, for example, if the process failed, the FlowFile would likely be redirected to the
                    <code>failure</code> route, or if it succeeded, it would go to the <code>success</code> route. </p>
                <blockquote class="tip">
                    <p> There are also other routes for other purposes. For example, if you just transformed the data,
                        but would like to still use the unchanged FlowFile, check if the processor has a relationship
                        labelled <code>original</code>. </p>
                </blockquote>
                <figure>
                    <img src="res/invokehttp-relationships.png" alt="InvokeHTTP Relationships" />
                    <figcaption>It's like a choose your own adventure book, but with more HTTP.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p> When you make a connection, the processor needs to know what output route to get the data from. For
                    most connections, you're probably looking for <code>success</code>. <code>Failure</code> is usually
                    only used if you want to log it or if you want to retry. Relationships are very useful for routing
                    data where it needs to go. The RouteOnAttribute processor has user defined routes with regex-like
                    syntax so you can define how and where a particular FlowFile goes in the flow. </p>
                <p> If a route isn't being used (which is going to be most of them), NiFi will detect that the route
                    doesn't go anywhere and automatically terminates the relationship. <strong>Just kidding</strong>,
                    you need to set each individual relationship to terminate manually, or NiFi isn't even going to try
                    to deal with it. </p>
                <h3 id="using-processors">Using Processors</h3>
                <p> Now that you have your processor all linked up and configured, it's time to start it. To start a
                    processor, right click it and click "Start". Ensure you don't right click and start the background
                    because that will start <em>every</em> processor on the canvas. You can also choose to Run Once,
                    which is very useful for debugging. </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="res/invokehttp-error.png" alt="InvokeHTTP Error" />
                    <figcaption>You're gonna see these little guys a lot. Fortunately, they won't halt your flow.
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p> If a processor has an error, it will display a little red icon in the corner for about five minutes
                    which will tell you the details of the error when hovered over. The same details will also be
                    visible in the bulletin board, which is available in the top right hamburger menu. The flow file
                    will then be redirected to the failure relationship for further analyses. </p>

                <h3 id="processor-groups">Processor Groups</h3>
                <p> Processor groups are groups—get this—composed of processors. They can be used to abstract otherwise
                    convoluted functions into a single node, or just to make a section small enough to fit in your flow.
                    Unlike traditional nodes, Process Groups can have multiple ingresses going to different input nodes
                    within it. </p>
                <p>To create a group, highlight the processors you want to group and <del>press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
                        <kbd>G</kbd></del> right click and click group. Inside a group, you can set input and output
                    nodes and these will be used to connect with the outside world. </p>
                <p>Unlike you might expect, you can't use a group like a function and reference it in multiple places,
                    but it does make it easier to copy if you need to.</p>
                <h3 id="templates">Templates</h3>
                <p> Select part of your flow, right click and click "Create Template". Give it a name and click
                    "Create". You now have a copy of your flow stored in the templates. These can be recreated at any
                    time by dragging it from your palette onto the canvas. You can also import and export templates,
                    making it the only tangible way to save backups of your flow. </p>
                <blockquote class="tip">
                    <p>You should backup your templates often, because, as mentioned above, there is no "undo" function.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <figure>

                    <figcaption>Database connection not working? Just create a new DBCPConnectionPool. I'm sure no one
                        will care.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <h3 id="controller-services">Controller Services</h3>
                <p> Sometimes, you need to share configuration or resources between multiple processors. Maybe you have
                    ten processors all talking to the same database, and you don't want to configure the connection
                    details ten times. That's where controller services come in. The idea is to avoid configuring the
                    same thing over and over again for every Processor that needs it. You could, for example, have a
                    database connection pool defined as a Controller Service, and then any Processor that needs to talk
                    to that database can just reference the service. </p>
                <p> To create or manage controller services, you'll need to navigate to the highest scope you want the
                    controller service to exist in. In most cases this will be the main canvas. Then right click the
                    background and click <em>configure</em>. Then you want to switch to the controller services tab if
                    it isn't there already. Now that you're here, creating a controller service is just like creating a
                    processor. You can define properties, and name it, and validate properties, and name it; please name
                    your controller services. </p>
                <blockquote class="fun-fact">
                    <p>I can't read your mind, and I don't know why there's always at least nine services named
                        DBCPConnectionPool or which one actually has the database connection.</p>

                <h3 id="parameters">Parameters</h3>
                <p> Parameters are a lot like variables, but they couldn't be called that because they already had a
                    very similar feature called "variables", which were awful and apparently they just couldn't be
                    bothered to fix the existing feature. Every parameter has a context which groups parameters
                    together. After you have defined a parameter, you can reference it in almost any text input property
                    using the syntax: <nobr><code>#{context.property}</code>.</nobr>

                <p>NiFi has plenty of features you can use to make your flow more readable:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Processors can be renamed</strong> to better describe their function when it's unclear,
                        as is the case for those whose purpose is defined in the properties, such as
                        <em>ExecuteScript</em>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Double clicking a connection path</strong> creates a bend which can then be moved
                        around. This should be used to move connection nodes and paths out of the way, so they're not
                        blocking any information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Labels</strong> are exactly what they sound like; small components with no function
                        other than as a container to hold some text. Like all nodes, they can be colored, and you can
                        use this to make the purpose of sections of your flow more clear.
                    </li>
                    <li>The <strong>align tool</strong> is located in the right click menu and simply aligns nodes
                        vertically or horizontally.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Funnels</strong> can be used to streamline connection paths. They're like processors
                        that do nothing except take all input FlowFiles and put them on the output path.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <blockquote class="tip">
                    <p> Using these features you can create elaborate and beautiful flows that's as easy to read as it
                        is functional—or you could just make incomprehensible spiderwebs like everyone else. </p>

                    and export your flows, and name your controller services. Just don't mess with my flow
                    and I won't mess with yours. </p>
