            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                NiFi is a graphical flow-based tool by Apache, designed to automate data flow between systems, working
                in the ETL (extract, transform, load) model. Looking at a fully formed flow in NiFi might look
                intimidating with its nodes and strings going in every direction, but it's actually incredibly simple.
                If you are familiar with<strong>Flow Based Programming</strong>, working with NiFi should be effortless.
                A flow in NiFi has two main objects that make it up: <em>FlowFiles</em> and <em>Components</em>.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="tip fun-fact">

            <h2>FlowFiles</h2>
            <p>
                <em>FlowFiles</em> are individual objects that are the data in the system. Think of them as JSON objects
                that are being pushed around, sorted, and transformed by the Processors.Each FlowFile has a
                <code>content</code> attribute, which represents the actual body of data (which can be empty), as well
                as a collection of other attributes which usually act as metadata for information about where the file
                came from and where it should go. At any given moment, FlowFiles are blazing through the system at some
                immeasurable speed, and they can be hard to observe individually while it's running. The only place they
                really exist is in the Queues between processors waiting for their turn.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="tip">
                <p>Tracking these FlowFiles through the system is an important skill necessary in figuring out what the
                    hell went wrong. Can't find a FlowFile? Right click and click refresh.</p>

            <h2>Components</h2>
            <p>
                Components are the actual nodes on the canvas. Your components are listed on the top bar in your
                component palette. All of these are entirely unnecessary with the exception of the first option—the
                processor, which is the workhorse of the flow.

            <h3>Processors</h3>
            <p>
                Processors are the nodes in the system that actually do the work. They are generally designed to do one
                thing to a FlowFile. Think of each of these as one function call. You may be wondering, "Why create a
                complicated flow when the same process would be much simpler to make in a real programming language?"
                Anyway, processors extract, transform, and load the FlowFiles. Processor functions include pulling data
                from APIs or databases, routing FlowFiles based on its attributes, running a JSON transformation
                routine, and even running scripts.
            </p>
            <p>
                To create a processor, you click and drag the processor icon from the palette onto the canvas where you
                want it, like a child playing with LEGO.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="tip">
                <p>
                    Now's a good time to bring up that if you're stressing about being able to use a bunch of handy
                    keyboard shortcuts—don't worry! NiFi has virtually <em>none</em>—not even undo! Be very careful with
                    the flow!
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                After you place the processor, a window will appear showing hundreds of different processor options, at
                which point you might wonder why this couldn't have just been a button. The processors are helpfully
                tagged and sorted according to their functions, so if you know you need to interact with a JSON, you can
                just click the JSON tag and see all the options applicable.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="res/all-processors.png" alt="All processors" />
            </figure>
            <h3>Properties—Configuring Processors</h3>
            <p>
                The properties tab is where you can specify the key/value pairs that the processor uses to make its
                decisions. Let's have a look at the <strong>InvokeHTTP</strong> processor's properties by double
                clicking it.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="res/invokehttp.png" alt="InvokeHTTP" />
            </figure>
            <p>
                As you can see, there are a lot of properties, most of which you can safely ignore. The necessary ones
                are <strong>highlighted in bold</strong>, and the question mark icons can be hovered over to get further
                information about the property. Remember that you can't configure a processor while it's running.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you've configured the processor correctly, you can click the checkbox in the upper right-hand
                corner to see if NiFi agrees. Once everything is in order you can click <em>Apply</em>. It's important
                to keep in mind that if the processor isn't entirely happy with its configuration, it will refuse to
                start.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="tip fun-fact">
                <p>NiFi was made for little babies</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h3>Relationships—Connecting Processors</h3>
            <p>
                After a few processors are on the flow, you can connect them together by dragging a line from the former
                to the latter, depending on which direction you want data to flow. Next, it's gonna ask you for which
                relationship you're trying to create the connection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Processors have inputs and outputs where the data goes through. Processors can have many output
                conditions, for example, if the process failed, the FlowFile would likely be redirected to the
                <code>failure</code> route, or if it succeeded, it would go to the <code>success</code> route.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="tip">
                <p>
                    There are also other routes for other purposes. For example, if you just transformed the data, but
                    would like to still use the unchanged FlowFile, check if the processor has a relationship labelled
                    <code>original</code>.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <figure>
                <img src="res/invokehttp-relationships.png" alt="InvokeHTTP Relationships" />
            </figure>
            <p>
                When you make a connection, the processor needs to know what output route to get the data from. For most
                connections, you're probably looking for <code>success</code>. <code>Failure</code> is usually only used
                if you want to log it or if you want to retry. Relationships are very useful for routing data where it
                needs to go. The RouteOnAttribute processor has user defined routes with regex-like syntax so you can
                define how and where a particular FlowFile goes in the flow.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a route isn't being used (which is going to be most of them), NiFi will detect that the route doesn't
                go anywhere and automatically terminates the relationship. <strong>Just kidding</strong>, you need to
                set each individual relationship to terminate manually, or NiFi isn't even going to try to deal with it.
            </p>
            <h3>Using Processors</h3>
            <p>
                Now that you have your processor all linked up and configured, it's time to start it. To start a
                processor, right click it and click "Start". Ensure you don't right click and start the background
                because that will start <em>every</em> processor on the canvas. You can also choose to Run Once, which
                is very useful for debugging.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="res/invokehttp-error.png" alt="InvokeHTTP Error" />
            </figure>
            <p>
                If a processor has an error, it will display a little red icon in the corner for about five minutes
                which will tell you the details of the error when hovered over. The same details will also be visible in
                the bulletin board, which is available in the top right hamburger menu. The flow file will then be
                redirected to the failure relationship for further analyses.

            <h2>Other Features</h2>
            <h3>Processor Groups</h3>
            <p>
                Processor groups are groups—get this—composed of processors. They can be used to abstract otherwise
                convoluted functions into a single node, or just to make a section small enough to fit in your flow.
                Unlike traditional nodes, Process Groups can have multiple ingresses going to different input nodes
                within it. To create a group, highlight the processors you want to group and <del>press Ctrl + G</del>
                right click and click group. Inside a group, you can set input and output nodes and these will be used
                to connect with the outside world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike you might expect, you can't use a group like a function and reference it in multiple places, but
                it does make it easier to copy if you need to.
            </p>
            <h3>Templates</h3>
            <p>
                Select part of your flow, right click and click "Create Template". Give it a name and click "Create".
                You now have a copy of your flow stored in the templates. These can be recreated at any time by dragging
                it from your palette onto the canvas. You can also import and export templates, making it the only
                tangible way to save backups of your flow.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="tip">
                <p>You should backup your templates often, because, as mentioned above, there is no "undo" function.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="res/controller-services.png" alt="Controller Services" />
            </figure>
            <h3>Controller Services</h3>
            <p>
                Sometimes, you need to share configuration or resources between multiple processors. Maybe you have ten
                processors all talking to the same database, and you don't want to configure the connection details ten
                times. That's where controller services come in. The idea is to avoid configuring the same thing over
                and over again for every Processor that needs it. You could, for example, have a database connection
                pool defined as a Controller Service, and then any Processor that needs to talk to that database can
                just reference the service.
            </p>
            <p>
                To create or manage controller services, you'll need to navigate to the highest scope you want the
                controller service to exist in. In most cases this will be the main canvas. Then right click the
                background and click <em>configure</em>. Then you want to switch to the controller services tab if it
                isn't there already. Now that you're here, creating a controller service is just like creating a
                processor. You can define properties, and name it, and validate properties, and name it; please name
                your controller services.

                    I can't read your mind, and I don't know why there's always at least nine services named
                    DBCPConnectionPool or which one actually has the database connection.

            <h3>Parameters</h3>
            <p>
                Parameters are a lot like variables, but they couldn't be called that because they already had a very
                similar feature called "variables", which were awful and apparently they just couldn't be bothered to
                fix the existing feature. Every parameter has a context which groups parameters together. After you have
                defined a parameter, you can reference it in almost any text input property using the syntax:
                <nobr><code>#{context.property}</code>.</nobr>

            <p>NiFi has plenty of features you can use to make your flow more readable:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Processors can be renamed</strong> to better describe their function when it's unclear, as
                    is the case for those whose purpose is defined in the properties, such as <em>ExecuteScript</em>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Double clicking a connection path</strong> creates a bend which can then be moved around.
                    This should be used to move connection nodes and paths out of the way, so they're not blocking any
                    information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Labels</strong> are exactly what they sound like; small components with no function other
                    than as a container to hold some text. Like all nodes, they can be colored, and you can use this to
                    make the purpose of sections of your flow more clear.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <strong>align tool</strong> is located in the right click menu and simply aligns nodes
                    vertically or horizontally.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Funnels</strong> can be used to streamline connection paths. They're like processors that do
                    nothing except take all input FlowFiles and put them on the output path.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote class="tip">
                <p>
                    Using these features you can create elaborate and beautiful flows that's as easy to read as it is
                    functional—or you could just make incomprehensible spiderwebs like everyone else.

            <p>
                Well, that's everything, I think. Keep it clean, bend your paths, group your processors, template and
                export your flows, and name your controller services. Just don't mess with my flow and I won't mess with
                yours.
